# Objective:
The objective of this project is to use a dataset of thin blood shear slide images provided by TensorFlow datasets to diagnose if the segmented cell is infected or not.
# Method used:
As the dataset consists of images, it is a computer vision problem. Hence, I am using a Convolution neural network to solve the classification problem. To follow the detailed method, you can view the provided jupyter notebook.
# Result:
On the 10 percent test set that I created from the original dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 94%.
